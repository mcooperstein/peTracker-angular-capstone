# peTracker-angular-capstone
## Introduction
Have you ever come home and not known whether or not your pet has been fed yet, or needs to be let out to go to the bathroom? Well now you never have to worry about that thanks to PeTracker, an Angular.js web application designed to help you 
and your family keep tabs on your pets. Well PeTracker's daily log allows the pet's owners to post any sort of pertient information in the pet's daily log (which is reset each day).
PeTracker also allows you to keep medical records and important information stored in the pet's profile history. This way you can log into the application to see whether or not your pet has received
a certain vaccination, medical treatment, etc. And lastly, you can store/keep track of your pet's upcoming appointments and delete them as they come and go. Organizing your pet's records and schedules has never been so easy, thanks to PeTracker.
## Known Bugs/Issues
Working on adding a local storage (ngStorage) component to have a functional database component to store pet data. 
## To-Do List
Would like to add a backend database component when I start learning Node/MongoDB.
Would like to add functionality that allows you to add and delete pet profiles
Way down the road, I would like to be able to add login functionality.
