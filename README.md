# peTracker-angular-capstone
This is my Angular.js final project as part of Thinkful's Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course
## Introduction
Have you ever come home and not known whether or not your pet has been fed, or needs to be let out to go to the bathroom? Well now you never have to worry about that thanks to PeTracker, an Angular.js web application designed to help you 
and your family keep tabs on your pets. PeTracker's daily log allows the pet's owners to post any sort of pertient information in the pet's daily log (which is reset each day).
PeTracker also allows you to keep medical records and important information stored in the pet's profile history. This way you can log into the application to see whether or not your pet has received
a certain vaccination, medical treatment, etc. And lastly, you can store/keep track of your pet's upcoming appointments and delete them as they come and go. Organizing your pet's records and schedules has never been so easy, thanks to PeTracker.
## Project Specs
The project specifications laid out were as follows: Plan and architect your app idea, and then design it from the ground up using your skills and knowledge acquired through the Angular.js course. 
## Programming Skills Used/Demonstrated
1. Angular Templating and Data Binding
2. Angular Directives: ng-repeat, ng-model, ng-class, etc. allowing users to manipulate data and have the HTML automatically re-render.  
3. Modules, Controllers, Services, and Scope in Angular
4. Route transitions with CSS animations
5. Unit Testing and E2E Testing with Jasmine/Karma and Protractor 

## Known Bugs/Issues
1. Working on adding a local storage (ngStorage) component to have a functional database component to store pet data.
2. Add/Delete Links on Homepage aren't functional and instead link to Rick Astley's 1987 masterpiece "Never Gonna Give You Up" and a GoPro video I shot/edited for my previous employer, Amici's East Coast Pizzeria.

## To-Do List
1. Would like to add a backend database component when I start learning Node/MongoDB.
2. Would like to add functionality that allows you to add and delete pet profiles
3. Way down the road, I would like to be able to add login functionality.
